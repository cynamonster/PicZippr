# React-powered Unsplash API Image Search

This application was created by Ben Cynamon alongside Steven Grider's [Udemy React course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux).

### [Try it out](http://cynamonster.github.io/react-image-search)

Entering a word or phrase will query a GET request to the Unsplash API, returning a maximum of 10 images.
This request is competed with the Axios HTTP client.
The app utilizes CSS Flex, Grid, and the [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com) stylesheet.
